    "- 2. A buzzing insect ‚Üí BEE\n",
    "- 3. Opposite of hot ‚Üí COLD\n",
    "- 4. Laugh out loud (abbr.) ‚Üí LOL\n",
    "- 5. Fifth vowel ‚Üí U\n",
    "\n",
    "**DOWN:**\n",
    "- 2. Bread ingredient ‚Üí FLOUR (but we only need 'P' from this word)\n",
    "- 3. Opposite of night ‚Üí DAY\n",
    "- 4. Giggle sound ‚Üí LAUGH (but we only need 'L' from this word)\n",
    "- 5. Evergreen tree ‚Üí PINE (but we only need 'E' from this word)\n",

    "5 U R D E E\n",

    "\n",
    "However, I notice some inconsistencies when checking this solution. Let me verify each position:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Row 2: B is correct, and BEE works for \"buzzing insect,\" but not all down clues fit.\n",

    "- 2 DOWN: Bread ingredient that starts with 'P' ‚Üí FLOUR doesn't work. It should be PASTA or PASTE\n",
    "- 3 DOWN: Opposite of night that starts with 'P' ‚Üí DAY doesn't work. It should be PM (evening)\n",
    "- 4 DOWN: Giggle sound that starts with 'L' ‚Üí LAUGH works partially\n",
    "- 5 DOWN: Evergreen tree that starts with 'E' ‚Üí PINE doesn't work. It should be ELM\n",
    "\n",
    "The completed grid should be:\n",

    "1 A P P L E\n",
    "2 B E E P E\n",
    "3 C O L D E\n",
    "4 H A H A E\n",
    "5 E W E E E\n",

    "3 C O L D E\n",
