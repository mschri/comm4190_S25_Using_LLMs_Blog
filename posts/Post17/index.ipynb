    "## How Good is ChatGPT at Translating Languages\n",
    "\n",
    "As per to the brief web search performed before this blog post, it seems that a number of opinions online would agree that ChatGPT is pretty good at translation, and in fact may be better than the average online translator tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to its description of its own capabilities, ChatGPT is quite good at handling translations pretty well, particularly for more common languages and texts. And, if prompted relatively straightforward translations, the model will perform with ease.\n",
    "\n",
    "> How about processing more complex pieces of language, say, sayings! (idioms...)\n",
    "\n",
    "What about prompting the model to process colloquialisms and particularities within a given language? With idioms for example, because they are so culturally and contextually dependent in most cases, LLMs experience some limitations in being able to accurately and properly reproduce the text or translate/understand it.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that, an interesting way of testing these model's limits could involve not just asking it to translate text, but one in that involves heavy usage of these kinds of complex language patterns. Because ChatGPT still excels at being able to *recognize* idioms, I started by asking it to simply: \"Write a short poem using only idoms.\" No other creative constraints were added or specified, this was simply just to start off the conversation and see what it came up with, and the answer was this:\n",

The lines suggest that while life can be full of hard work (\"burn the midnight oil,\" \"chase rainbows\"), there are also moments of relief and success (\"a piece of cake,\" \"keep your chin up\"). It touches on the inevitability of challenges and surprises (\"when pigs fly,\" \"hell breaks loose\") but encourages perseverance and a positive outlook (\"ride it out,\" \"every cloud has clout\"). Overall, it speaks to embracing both the tough and easy moments, knowing they’re all part of the journey.\n",

    "## A few observations:\n",
    "Disregarding how off the third translation was (including this time the title unforunately...), the summary of this poem wasn't as far off as it was to the first; the summaries maintained similar themes of perseverence, hard work, and accepting challenges. The second summary had a little more to do with \"staying true\" to one's character and keeping composure against the nonsensical obstacles of life, while the first summary was more concerned with capturing an \"inevitability\" aspect of life, knowing how to embrace the bad along with the good, and emphasizing more of the journey aspect to approaching challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "In sum, the model did its best to maintain the ethos of both poems, and could understand/analyze it fairly consistently. Of course, the translations themselves got to be pretty far off by the end of it. Considering this, it's quite impressive how well it tapped into the original meaning (although maybe it just guessed after all...) given that the context necessary for interpretting idiomatic language was clearly lost by the third translation!\n",
    "\n",
    "What these limitations **do** also reveal is ChatGPT's non-built in translation function. As a purely, highly intelligent textual analysis processor, it doesn't rely on word-to-word translations (especially more complex language translations like that from English to Japanese or vice versa) but instead uses the context surrounding the sentence structure or phrases to generate accurate-enough sounding text. Therefore, when you play around too much with the prompting in this way and fail to give it enough contextual understanding of what you might be seeking to translate, it might get the character of your sentiment very wrong!"
