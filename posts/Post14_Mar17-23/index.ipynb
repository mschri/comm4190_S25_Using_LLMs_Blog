    "## Last Time\n",
    "\n",
    "Picking up from where we left off last time, I tried testing LLMs against how well they can fill out a cross word puzzle...and a faulty one at that...the idea was to first see how well an LLM can generate a crossword puzzle--given its renowned talent in mimicing and generating human-like speech, and then in separate chat logs/prompting a second model asking them to evaluate the puzzle itself (knowing that the \"down\" clues were not exactly accurately generated).\n",
    "\n",
    "In sum, the LLM's did ok in filling out the puzzle as much as they could given the constraints of the clues and actual solutions. Today, I thought I would extend the experiment to track their learning capacities and see how well they can generate more accurate puzzles over a number of trials. So, within the same, original chat log as the first experiment in which I asked to generate a cross word puzzle, I prompted ChatGPT to do so again and to refine its approach (by letting it know it made a mistake in the first):\n",

    "## Second time around, let's produce another cross word puzzle:\n",
    "\n",
    "I asked Chat to refine it's approach with the following prompt: \n",
