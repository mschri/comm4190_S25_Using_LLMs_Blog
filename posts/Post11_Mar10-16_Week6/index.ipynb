    "## Revisiting Priming\n",
    "\n",
    "In a previous blog of mine, I examined some of the effects of priming on ChatGPT by examining how earlier responses and prompts in a conversation with the model would affect successive outputs. In that earlier blog, I examined its presentation of historical information with respect to initial prompt-biases/seeing how it reacted when I included skewed perspectives within the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today's exercise will revisit this topic, and expand further on the effects of priming within responses to ethical dilemmas by LLMs. Because ethical concerns are a highly subjective field of thought, prompting these models and requesting their opinions is already an interesting experiment. Because the model is pulling from sources across the internet which represents a variety of opinions and beliefs, it's fascinating to see how the model answers morally ambiguous questions with no hard answer given that the information it's trained on has no hard answer itself. So, asking an LLM what might be right or wrong in a given situation might reveal some of the biases of an X-centric perspective that might be more widely represented within the text data."

    "## Trolley Dilemma\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most fundamental hypotheticals in the philosophical realm is that of the trolley case--pull the lever and kill many, or leave the train running on its tracks and kill one?\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost everything comes with its own moral tradeoffs, but this case represents one of the most famous forms of ambiguity, and illustrates several modes of thinking depending on your answer to the question and reasoning behind your answer. Among some of the most well-known perspectives associated with gut-reactions to the trolley dilemma include the **utilitarian approach**, **deontological** thinking, and the **virtue-ethics** consideration.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that, how might ChatGPT respond to the classic case? To gauge it's default reaction to the question, the model was prompted with the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    How would you resolve the trolley problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Chat, it's answer is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "The trolley problem is a classic ethical dilemma that challenges us to make tough decisions about morality, consequences, and values. It involves a situation where you have to choose whether to divert a runaway trolley onto a track that will kill one person, or do nothing and let it kill five people. There are different ways to approach this dilemma depending on your ethical perspective. Here's a breakdown of some possible approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Utilitarianism** (Maximizing Well-Being)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Decision**: Pull the lever to divert the trolley onto the track with one person, as this minimizes the overall harm.\n",
    "* **Reasoning**: From a utilitarian standpoint, you would choose the action that maximizes the greatest good for the greatest number. The idea is that saving five lives at the cost of one is the better outcome overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Deontology** (Duty-Based Ethics)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Decision**: Do not pull the lever.\n",
    "* **Reasoning**: According to deontological ethics, some actions are morally wrong regardless of the consequences. In this case, intentionally causing harm (even if it saves more lives) would violate moral duties, such as the duty not to kill. Thus, the act of actively deciding to kill one person might be seen as morally worse than allowing the natural course of events.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Virtue Ethics** (Character and Intentions)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Decision**: The decision would depend on what a virtuous person would do in this situation.\n",
    "* **Reasoning**: A virtue ethicist might focus on the character traits that guide the decision, such as compassion, wisdom, and courage. They might argue that you should act with compassion to minimize harm, but also consider the long-term consequences of your actions on your moral character.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Care Ethics** (Relational and Contextual)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Decision**: This approach might be more focused on the relationships involved.\n",
    "* **Reasoning**: A care ethicist might argue that relationships and the context of the situation matter. If you are closer to the person on the track (perhaps a loved one), your decision might change based on your emotional and relational duties. The focus is more on care and responsibility rather than a strict calculation of lives saved.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **The \"No Action\" Option**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Decision**: Do nothing and let the trolley continue on its path.\n",
    "* **Reasoning**: Some people argue that inaction in situations like this is the more ethical choice. This stance believes that it’s better to not intervene at all, as interfering could be seen as making a moral decision to take a life, which may not be justified.\n",
    "\n",
    "### My Personal Take:\n",
    "\n",
    "I lean toward **utilitarianism** in this specific case, where the goal is to minimize harm and save more lives. However, I do think this problem oversimplifies moral decisions because real-life situations are rarely so clear-cut. The psychological toll of making such a decision, or the complex relationships involved, would likely influence the moral reasoning.\n",

    "### To which it responded...\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose the **utilitarian** approach because it's often seen as the most straightforward and pragmatic way to resolve moral dilemmas like the trolley problem. The core of utilitarianism is to maximize overall well-being, which in this case means saving as many lives as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s why I lean toward it in this scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Minimizing Harm**: The basic principle is about minimizing harm and suffering. By diverting the trolley, you save five lives at the cost of one. From a utilitarian standpoint, this is the most efficient way to reduce overall harm.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Clear Outcome**: In a situation where a clear decision needs to be made quickly, utilitarianism provides a measurable, quantitative solution (saving five vs. one). It reduces the ambiguity involved in moral reasoning by focusing on outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Pragmatic Approach**: It’s a practical way to handle the dilemma without getting too bogged down in abstract moral rules or subjective factors. In a life-and-death situation, utilitarianism offers a clear, actionable choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, I do acknowledge that there are complexities in real-life situations that make the utilitarian approach harder to apply, such as emotional and relational factors, or concerns about whether it’s ethical to actively intervene in causing harm, even for a good outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "The trolley problem, while useful for thought experiments, doesn’t capture the nuances of real-world ethics, but utilitarianism provides a clear framework to make difficult decisions when faced with competing options.\n",

    "## Priming Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first question, there wasn't a hint of bias within the question, or inclusion of any kind of information that migth skew the response of the program. Transitioning now from a neutral input to one with slightly more leaning, I asked the program in a new chat log:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Chat then proceeded with this response:\n",
    "\n",
    "The trolley problem is a fascinating ethical dilemma, and your perspective about valuing individual lives is one that many people share. It highlights a conflict between utilitarianism (maximizing overall well-being) and deontological ethics (which focuses on duties and moral rules, like not directly causing harm to others). Here are a few ways to think about it:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Utilitarian Approach:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A utilitarian would likely pull the lever, as the goal is to minimize overall harm. In this case, by diverting the trolley to a track where it kills one person instead of five, you're reducing the total number of lives lost.\n",
    "* The reasoning is that the consequences (fewer deaths) justify the action, even if it involves taking a direct role in causing someone's death.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Deontological (Rule-Based) Approach:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A deontologist might argue that it's wrong to actively intervene, even if it means saving more lives, because pulling the lever means directly causing harm to an individual. In this case, they would let the trolley continue on its path and accept the five deaths as unfortunate, but would not take the action that intentionally causes harm.\n",
    "* The idea here is that moral rules, such as “don’t kill,” should not be broken, even for the sake of a greater good.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Virtue Ethics:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* From the virtue ethics standpoint, the decision might focus on the character traits of the person making the choice. The right decision might be influenced by values like compassion, bravery, or wisdom.\n",
    "* A virtuous person might consider the broader context of the situation, such as the potential for future moral growth or societal implications of such decisions, rather than simply focusing on an immediate utilitarian calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **The Value of an Individual Life:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Your belief that individual lives are invaluable can make the decision especially difficult. If you view each life as sacred and unique, it might lead to a reluctance to make a decision that intentionally sacrifices a single person, even for the sake of saving more.\n",
    "* In this case, you might seek a third option, such as trying to warn or help those on the tracks, or maybe considering the fairness of the situation—why should any of these lives be sacrificed?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, there’s no \"one right answer.\" Many people wrestle with this problem because it forces us to choose between moral principles that seem both important. What’s your gut feeling when you think about the scenario? Would you prioritize the collective good, or the sanctity of individual lives?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Here,\n",
    "The model intitially refrained from answering directly one way or another, representing some deviation from its original, default position of utilitarianism. To poke and prod further and get a real answer, I then asked it:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"Ok, but if you really had to choose just one option, which would you choose?\"\n",

    "## So,\n",
    "it thankfully did a better job of getting to the heart of the issue. It seems that priming only warded off what would be the same answer to the question for only a moment longer; it didn't affect it's ultimate decision to stay true to the utilitarian method, despite maybe taking one more prompt to reveal its verdict. \n",
    "\n",
    "And so to finish off the discussion, I asked it one last question:\n",
    "    \"Why did you choose this option?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "To which it replied:\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose the **utilitarian approach** because, in a scenario like the trolley problem, the fundamental goal seems to be reducing overall harm and suffering, even if that means making a difficult, emotionally charged decision. The utilitarian view is often grounded in the idea that we should prioritize the greatest good for the greatest number of people.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's why this approach makes sense to me, in a broader context:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Minimizing Harm**: The utilitarian perspective would weigh the consequences of the action. By sacrificing one life, the decision leads to saving five. The reasoning here is that five lives lost is much worse than one, in terms of overall harm.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Pragmatism**: While it’s painful to consider that one person must die to save many, the pragmatic aspect of the dilemma might suggest that it's better to act in a way that reduces the total amount of harm and loss. It feels like an unfortunate but necessary decision in a crisis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Moral Trade-offs**: The decision involves balancing two morally significant outcomes—saving lives and upholding moral rules about not causing harm. Utilitarianism helps navigate this by focusing more on the outcome rather than the means, which might seem cold but has a certain clarity in its pursuit of the best possible overall result.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this approach isn’t without its flaws or moral discomforts. It doesn’t sit well with everyone, especially for those who believe in the intrinsic value of every individual life, regardless of how many others are involved. The emotional difficulty of choosing the lesser harm, especially when we’re directly involved in causing it, is very real.\n",

    "Would you find yourself more inclined to protect the individual, or would the greater good take precedence for you?\n"

    "Following suit to the above conversational flow, I asked it the why. Chat then provided this answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose to resolve the trolley problem in this way because I was reflecting on the **deontological ethics** perspective, which emphasizes following moral rules or duties rather than focusing solely on the consequences of actions. Deontologists argue that there are certain actions that are morally wrong, regardless of the outcome. In this context, actively choosing to divert the trolley and kill one person to save five might be viewed as morally problematic because you are intentionally causing harm to one individual.\n",
    "\n",
    "By not pulling the lever, you avoid making that direct choice, even though it results in more harm (the death of five people).

    "Ah, I see what you're asking now—why did I specifically choose to represent the **deontological ethical framework** in resolving the trolley problem, rather than another ethical approach?\n",

    "I went with that framework because, in your initial response, you expressed a clear preference for **saving one life over many**, which suggests that you're prioritizing individual moral duties or rights over calculating the greater good.
