    "## LLMs and Contextual Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "As we know, LLMs have an acute pattern recognition and contextual understanding based on the prompts that users feed it. It's well-versed in a variety of problems and puzzles people have managed to think up, and its intelligent includes a number of techniques involved in language processing. For example, it relies primarily on its language modeling (the large textual dataset it's trained on), along with basic trial and error measures, simple deciphering methods, and other coding mechanisms that anyone could likely implement themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Experiment:\n",
    "In the spirit of stretching prompt complexity to see how LLMs respond and react, I came up with a relatively simple code using a one-to-one character mapping, and seeing if the LLM could decipher the sentences I fed it. This was to test the contextual understanding and pattern recognition capabilities of LLMs, and see how quickly (or slowly) they can pick up a complex input. "
