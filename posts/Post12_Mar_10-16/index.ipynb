    "Various reasons explain why the model fails to generate the exact same image more than once, outlined by the following primary principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "> 1. ***Stochasticity***: image generation is based on the diffusion process, which starts from random noise-which will be different at the start of each chat log-and is gradually sculpted (refined) to form a coherent image.\n",
    ">    * There is also at the current moment, no feature that sets or reuses seeds meaning every seed containing the noise will always be random.\n",
    "> 2. ***Prompt Subjectivity***: if there's even a hint of subjectivity within the prompt, new chat logs without other logs' context windows, may interpret your request perhaps even just a touch differently each time.\n",
    ">    * Especially with more creative descriptions, the internal framework of ChatGPT optimizes creativity in its output, meaning it will always choose the most innovative response produced out of a continuously refined retrieval process."

These are just slight variances over a total of four trials, given that its free access can only give you so many images at time...but it would be further interesting to see how drastically the photo might change with MANY iterations at a time!"
