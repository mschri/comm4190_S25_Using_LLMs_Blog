# Blog: Experimenting with AI/LLMs

This GitHub repository contains the notebook files and information used to create each blog post in the following linked file: https://mschri.github.io/comm4190_S25_Using_LLMs_Blog/

These blogs are each about mini experiments done with LLMs. The primary framework used in some of these posts is PyTorch, and Transformers models were deployed.
